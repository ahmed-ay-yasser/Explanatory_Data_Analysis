# Explanatory Data Analysis - Retail

## Project Description
This project aims at performing an explanatory data analysis on a retail superstore dataset. This project was a part of a one-month Data Science & Business Analytics online internship at The Sparks Foundation from Feb 2022 to Mar 2022. The tools used for the analysis:
- _**Excel**_: For exploring & modificating the data. 
- _**Python**_: As the programming language used for the analysis.
- _**Jupyter Notebook**_: Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- _**Power BI**_: was used to create an informative & interactive dashboard.

## About the Data
The dataset used for this project was about "Sales Orders" occurred all over the United States. It consists of 9994 rows and 13 columns in a Xlsx file.

## Project Process
First, we explored the data to get an overview of the variables and records and get a solid understanding of the data. Then, Some modifications to the data was performed like adding an index column to the dataset as well as adding the “Cost” column to be further used during the analyses. We imported the xlsx file to the Jupyter Notebook environment and ran our analyses on the data. Finally, we exported the cleaned dataset to further use it to create an informative and interactive two-page dashboard.
